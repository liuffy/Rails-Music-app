  end

# Break up the lyrics on newlines.
# Insert a â™« at the start of each line (the html entity that will render as a music note is &#9835;).
# Properly escape the user input (avoid HTML injection attacks).
# Wrap the lyrics in a pre tag so that the newlines are respected (in a<pre> or preformatted text tag, whitespace is preserved).
# Mark the produced HTML as safe for insertion (otherwise your <pre> tag will get escaped when you insert it into the template).
# In Rails >= 4.2, you will need to include ERB::Util in your helper module.
